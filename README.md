# onnxruntime-mac :
Unlocking onnxruntime to maximize computing abilities of devices on MacOS, silicon and intel.  


## Silicon
Not sure yet of what triggered the change in neural engine, but ANE is being used now with CoreML execution provider.
It seems activity monitor as limited data but it sure is doing something in regards to byte written and the power consumption shown by powermetrics.
